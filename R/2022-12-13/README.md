# Monthly State Retail Sales

The data this week comes from the [United States Census Bureau's Monthly State Retail Sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/state_retail_sales.html).

The Monthly State Retail Sales (MSRS) is the Census Bureau's new experimental data product featuring modeled state-level retail sales.

The data updates monthly. We pulled the data on 2022-12-10, so this dataset runs through August of 2022.
