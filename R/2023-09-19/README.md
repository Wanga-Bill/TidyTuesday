# CRAN Package Authors

It's time for [posit::conf(2023L)](https://posit.co/conference/)!
To celebrate, the data this week comes from the [CRAN collaboration graph](https://github.com/schochastics/CRAN_collaboration), a project by David Schoch.

> The CRAN collaboration graph consists of R package developers who are connected if they appear together as authors of an R package in the DESCRIPTION file.

> The “Hadley number” is defined as the distance of R developers to Hadley Wickham in the collaboration graph. 

See the [README of the GitHub project](https://github.com/schochastics/CRAN_collaboration#readme) for a fun exploration of the data, and to see how it was gathered.
