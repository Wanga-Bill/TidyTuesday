# Lisa's Vegetable Garden Data

We're exploring Lisa Lendway's vegetable garden from summer 2020 and summer 2021, from her [{gardenR} package](https://github.com/llendway/gardenR).
Thank you to Lisa for [suggesting this dataset back in 2021](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/358)!

> The gardenR package contains data collected by Lisa Lendway from her vegetable garden, starting in the summer of 2020. Data from the summer of 2021 was added 2022-01-29 (finally!). The data were used in her Introduction to Data Science course at Macalester College to introduce many concepts. For examples, see the [tutorials for the course](https://ds112-lendway.netlify.app/).

Lisa also has a [YouTube video with a visual tour of the garden](https://www.youtube.com/embed/iGMgLFIiSxo).

What changed between 2020 and 2021?
