# Alone

The data this week comes from the [Alone data package](https://github.com/doehm/alone) by Dan Oehm. 

> This dataset contains data from the TV series [Alone](https://www.history.com/shows/alone) collected and shared by [Dan Oehm](https://gradientdescending.com/). As described in Oehm's blog post](https://gradientdescending.com/alone-r-package-datasets-from-the-survival-tv-series/), in the survival TV series ‘Alone,’ 10 survivalists are dropped in an extremely remote area and must fend for themselves. They aim to last 100 days in the Artic winter, living off the land through their survival skills, endurance, and mental fortitude. 

> This package contains four datasets:

> * survivalists.csv: A data frame of survivalists across all 9 seasons detailing name and demographics, location and profession, result, days lasted, reasons for tapping out (detailed and categorised), and page URL.

> * loadouts.csv: The rules allow each survivalist to take 10 items with them. This dataset includes information on each survivalist’s loadout. It has detailed item descriptions and a simplified version for easier aggregation and analysis

> * episodes.csv: This dataset contains details of each episode including the title, number of viewers, beginning quote, and IMDb rating. New episodes are added at the end of future seasons.

> * seasons.csv: The season summary dataset includes location, latitude and longitude, and other season-level information. It includes the date of drop-off where the information exists.
