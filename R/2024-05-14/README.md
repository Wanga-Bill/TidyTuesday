# The Great American Coffee Taste Test

In October 2023, ["world champion barista" James Hoffmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMOOQfeloH0) and [coffee company Cometeer](https://cometeer.com/pages/the-great-american-coffee-taste-test) held the "Great American Coffee Taste Test" on YouTube, during which viewers were asked to fill out a survey about 4 coffees they ordered from Cometeer for the tasting. [Data blogger Robert McKeon Aloe analyzed the data the following month](https://rmckeon.medium.com/great-american-coffee-taste-test-breakdown-7f3fdcc3c41d).

Do you think participants in this survey are representative of Americans in general?
