# Patient Risk Profiles

The virtual [R/Pharma Conference](https://rinpharma.com/) is happening this week!
To celebrate, we're exploring Patient Risk Profiles. 
Thank you to [Jenna Reps](https://github.com/jreps) for preparing this week's data!

> This dataset contains 100 simulated patient's medical history features and the predicted 1-year risk of 14 outcomes based on each patient's medical history features. The predictions used real logistic regression models developed on a large real world healthcare dataset.

Note: We did *not* clean the column names this week. 
This data looks more like the sort of data you're likely to encounter in the wild, so we thought it would be good practice to work with it as-is.
