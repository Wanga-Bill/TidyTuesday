# The Portal Project

The data this week comes from the [Portal
Project](https://portal.weecology.org/). This is a long-term ecological
research site studying the dynamics of desert rodents, plants, ants and
weather in Arizona.

> The Portal Project is a long-term ecological study being conducted
> near Portal, AZ. Since 1977, the site has been used to study the
> interactions among rodents, ants and plants and their respective
> responses to climate. To study the interactions among organisms, they
> experimentally manipulate access to 24 study plots. This study has
> produced over 100 scientific papers and is one of the longest running
> ecological studies in the U.S.

The [Weecology research group](https://www.weecology.org/) monitors
rodents, plants, ants, and weather. All data from the Portal Project are
made openly available in near real-time so that they can provide the
maximum benefit to scientific research and outreach. The core dataset is
managed using an automated living data workflow run using GitHub and
Continuous Analysis.

This dataset focuses on the rodent data. Full data is available through
these resources:

-   [GitHub Data Repository](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData)
-   [Live Updating Zenodo
    Archive](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1215988)

The Portal Project data can also be accessed through the Data Retriever,
a package manager for data.

A teaching focused version of the dataset is also maintained with some
of the complexities of the data removed to make it easy to use for
computational training purposes. This dataset serves as the core dataset
for the [Data Carpentry
Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/) material and has
been downloaded almost 50,000 times.
