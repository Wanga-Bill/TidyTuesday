# UFO Sightings Redux

The data this week comes from the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxshape.html), [cleaned](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/blob/main/01_ufo-data.qmd) and [enriched](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/blob/main/01_ufo-enrich.qmd) with data from [sunrise-sunset.org](https://sunrise-sunset.org/) by [Jon Harmon](https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/).

If this dataset looks familiar, that's because we [used a version of it back in 2019](https://tidytues.day/2019/2019-06-25). The new version adds the last several years of data, adds information about time-of-day, and cleans up some errors in the original dataset. We'd love to see visualizations describing the differences between the 2019 dataset and this new dataset!
