# Refugees

The data this week comes from PopulationStatistics {refugees} R package. 

> {refugees} is an R package designed to facilitate access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Refugee Data Finder. It provides an easy-to-use interface to the database, which covers forcibly displaced populations, including refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people, stateless people, and others over a span of more than 70 years.

This package provides data from three major sources:

- Data from UNHCR’s annual statistical activities dating back to 1951.
- Data from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), specifically for registered Palestine refugees under UNRWA’s mandate.
- Data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) on people displaced within their country due to conflict or violence.

The {refugees} package includes eight datasets. We're working with `population` with data from 2010 to 2022.
