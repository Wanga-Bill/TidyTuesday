# Childcare Costs

Happy Mothers Day! The data this week comes from the [National Database of Childcare Prices](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/featured-childcare).

> The National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) is the most comprehensive federal source of childcare prices at the county level. The database offers childcare price data by childcare provider type, age of children, and county characteristics. Data are available from 2008 to 2018.

Thanks this week to Thomas Mock for the submission, with a hat tip to [Jon Schwabish on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jschwabish/status/1626597782491639810?s=46&t=avwSC7an3lwX3FH35u0gMA) for pointing out the lack of labels on the original government-posted map.

Note: This dataset implies that "both parents" means one man and one woman. We recognize that this does not reflect the reality of every loving family.
