# Holiday Episodes

Happy holidays!
Last week we explored ["holiday" movies](../2023-12-12/readme.md).
This week we're exploring "holiday" TV episodes: individual episodes of TV shows with "holiday", "Christmas", "Hanukkah", or "Kwanzaa" (or variants thereof) in their title!

The data this week again comes from the [Internet Movie Database](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
We don't have an article using exactly this dataset, but you might get inspiration from the TVTropes [Holiday Episode](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolidayEpisode) article.
