# Holiday Movies

Happy holidays!
This week we're exploring "holiday" movies: movies with "holiday", "Christmas", "Hanukkah", or "Kwanzaa" (or variants thereof) in their title!

The data this week comes from the [Internet Movie Database](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
We don't have an article using exactly this dataset, but you might get inspiration from this [Christmas Movies](https://networkdatascience.ceu.edu/article/2019-12-16/christmas-movies) blog post by Mil√°n Janosov at Central European University.
