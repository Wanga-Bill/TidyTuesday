# US Populated Places

While we embark on a road trip for summer vacation, the data this week comes from the [National Map Staged Products Directory](https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=StagedProducts/GeographicNames/) from the [US Board of Geographic Names](https://www.usgs.gov/us-board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data).

Note: Quite a lot of more data is available from the GNIS. See the cleaning script for clues for downloading the additional data.
