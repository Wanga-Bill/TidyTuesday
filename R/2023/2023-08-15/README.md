# Spam E-mail

The data this week comes from Vincent Arel-Bundock's Rdatasets package(https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/index.html). 

> Rdatasets is a collection of 2246 datasets which were originally distributed alongside the statistical software environment R and some of its add-on packages. The goal is to make these data more broadly accessible for teaching and statistical software development.

We're working with the [spam email](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/DAAG/spam7.html) dataset. This is a subset of the [spam e-mail database](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/kernlab/html/spam.html).

This is a dataset collected at Hewlett-Packard Labs by Mark Hopkins, Erik Reeber, George Forman, and Jaap Suermondt and shared with the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase). The dataset classifies 4601 e-mails as spam or non-spam, with additional variables indicating the frequency of certain words and characters in the e-mail.
