# GPT detectors 

The data this week comes from Simon Couch's [detectors R package](https://github.com/simonpcouch/detectors/). containing predictions from various GPT detectors. 

The data is based on the pre-print:

GPT Detectors Are Biased Against Non-Native English Writers. Weixin Liang, Mert Yuksekgonul, Yining Mao, Eric Wu, James Zou. arXiv: [2304.02819](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02819)

> The study authors carried out a series of experiments passing a number of essays to different GPT detection models. Juxtaposing detector predictions for papers written by native and non-native English writers, the authors argue that GPT detectors disproportionately classify real writing from non-native English writers as AI-generated.
