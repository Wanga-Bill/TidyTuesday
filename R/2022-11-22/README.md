# Museums

The data this week comes from [Mapping Museums project](https://museweb.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/data).

The projectâ€™s research team has gathered, cleansed, and codified data relating to over 4000 UK museums - almost double the number of museums covered in any previous survey. It covers the period from 1960 to date. The challenges we faced and the processes we adopted to collect, integrate, and cleanse the data are described in our publications
