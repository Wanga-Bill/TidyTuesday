# Drought Conditions in the US

The data this week comes from the [National Integrated Drought Information System](https://www.drought.gov/). 

This [web page](https://www.drought.gov/historical-information?dataset=1&selectedDateUSDM=20110301&selectedDateSpi=19580901) provides more information about the drought conditions data.

> The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is an index to characterize meteorological drought on a range of timescales, ranging from 1 to 72 months, for the lower 48 U.S. states. The SPI is the number of standard deviations that observed cumulative precipitation deviates from the climatological average. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information produce the 9-month SPI values below on a monthly basis, going back to 1895.*

Additional data from the [Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/DSCI.aspx) with API access from: https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/WebServiceInfo.aspx#comp

> The Drought Severity and Coverage Index is an experimental method for converting drought levels from the U.S. Drought Monitor map to a single value for an area. DSCI values are part of the U.S. Drought Monitor data tables. Possible values of the DSCI are from 0 to 500. Zero means that none of the area is abnormally dry or in drought, and 500 means that all of the area is in D4, exceptional drought.

This dataset was covered by the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/11/climate/california-western-drought-map.html) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/17/weather/west-california-drought-maps/index.html).

The dataset for today ranges from 2001 to 2021, but again more data is available at the [Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/ComprehensiveStatistics.aspx).

Drought classification can be found on the [US Drought Monitor site](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/About/AbouttheData/DroughtClassification.aspx).
