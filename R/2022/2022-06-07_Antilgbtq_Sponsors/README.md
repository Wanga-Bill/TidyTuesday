# Pride sponsors who have donated to Anti−LGBTQ campaigns

Each year, hundreds of corporations around the country participate in Pride, an annual celebration of the LGBTQ+ community’s history and progress. They present themselves as LGBTQ+ allies, but new research from Data for Progress finds that in between their yearly parade appearances, dozens of these corporations are giving to state politicians behind some of the most bigoted and harmful policies in over a decade.

Activists and allies wishing to hold these politicians accountable for bigotry can begin by holding their corporate backers accountable. In a new project series, Data for Progress has compiled a set of resources for activists, employees, community leaders, and lawmakers to push back on these policies and the prejudice powering them. We provide research tying the political giving of specific Fortune 500 companies to anti-LGBTQ+ politicians in six states, polling showing that such giving hurts the brands’ favorability, and upcoming policy memos to understand the issue and to take action.

The data this week comes from [Data For Progress](https://www.dataforprogress.org/accountable-allies).
