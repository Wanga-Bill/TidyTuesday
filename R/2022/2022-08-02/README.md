Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa) telemetry and habitat use at Crane Prairie Reservoir in Oregon, USA.

Radio-telemetry has been used to study late-season movement and habitat use by Oregon spotted frogs (Rana pretiosa) at Crane Prairie Reservoir in Oregon. This dataset includes individual frog location data and habitat use during each tracking event that occurred roughly weekly between September and late November of 2018.

"...study adds to the limited data on late-season activity and habitat use in R. pretiosa. Information on seasonal habitat use, movement between seasonal habitat types, and habitats that are particularly valuable for maintaining populations is important to conservation and management. We tracked frogs within the main reservoir and in surrounding pond and river habitats, allowing for comparisons of movement relative to different habitat types and predatory threats."
