# Weather Forecast Accuracy

The data this week comes from the [USA National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/), as emailed by the University of Illinois list server and [processed by Sai Shreyas Bhavanasi, Harrison Lanier, Lauren Schmiedeler, and Clayton Strauch at the Saint Louis University Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://github.com/speegled/weather_forecasts). Thank you to [Darrin Speegle](https://github.com/speegled) for bringing the data to our attention!

The goal of this data science capstone project has been to acquire national weather data to learn which areas of the U.S. struggle with weather prediction and the possible reasons why. Specifically, we focused on the error in high and low temperature forecasting.

The data includes 16 months of forecasts and observations from 167 cities, as well as a separate data.frame of information about those cities and some other American cities.
