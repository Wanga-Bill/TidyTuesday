> What you should know about this indicator

> Objects are defined here as satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station flight elements launched into Earth orbit or beyond.

> This data is based on national registers of launches submitted to the UN by participating nations. According to UN estimates, the data captures around 88% of all objects launched.

> When an object is marked by the source as launched by a country on behalf of another one, the launch is attributed to the latter country.

> When a launch is made jointly by several countries, it is recorded in each of these countries' time series but only once in the 'World' series.
