# Bob Ross Paintings

The data this week comes from Jared Wilber's data on [Bob Ross Paintings](https://github.com/jwilber/Bob_Ross_Paintings/blob/master/data/bob_ross_paintings.csv) via @frankiethull [Bob Ross Colors data package](https://github.com/frankiethull/BobRossColors).

> This is data from the [paintings of Bob Ross](https://www.twoinchbrush.com/all-paintings) featured in the TV Show 'The Joy of Painting'.

@frankiethull created an R data package [{BobRossColors}](https://github.com/frankiethull/BobRossColors) with information on the palettes that leveraged imgpalr to mine divergent and qualitative colors from each painting image. In addition, unique Bob Ross named colors are in the package as well.

In the github repository of the dataset, there are also [pngs of the paintings](https://github.com/jwilber/Bob_Ross_Paintings/tree/master/data/paintings) themselves!

You might also want to check out our [previous Bob Ross dataset from 2019-08-06](https://tidytues.day/2019/2019-08-06) to see if there are correlations between named objects and named colors!
