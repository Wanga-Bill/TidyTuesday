# Programming Languages

The data this week comes from the [Programming Language DataBase](https://pldb.com/index.html). Thanks to [Jesus M. Castagnetto](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/530) for the suggestion!

The PLDB has a [blog](https://pldb.com/posts/index.html) with numerous articles exploring the data, such as [Does every programming language have line comments?](https://pldb.com/posts/does-every-programming-language-support-line-comments.html).

The data is user-submitted, so you might want to confirm the accuracy of anything particularly surprising that you find before stating it with certainty!
